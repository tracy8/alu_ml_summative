# Predicting STEM Potential of Rwandan Students using Linear Regression

## Mission
Help Rwandan students choose the right A-Level subjects by predicting their STEM potential using their grades and attendance.

## Problem
Many students pick wrong subjects because they don't know their strengths, leading to poor performance and limited career options.

## Dataset
Source: [Kaggle - Students Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/students-performance-dataset)

This dataset contains information such as students' gender, parental education level, lunch type, test preparation course, and scores in math, reading, and writing.


This is a FastAPI machine learning API that predicts students' academic potential.
